# FUTURE_CS_01
This repository contains theucting security testing on a sample web application to identify vulnerabilities such a s SQL Injection, Cross-site Scripting (XSS), and authentication flaws using tools like OWASP ZAP, Burp Suite, and SQLMap. The findings are documented in a detailed security report along with recommended mitigation strategies.
# 🔐 FUTURE_CS_01: Web Application Security Testing

## 🚀 Task Summary

I conducted **security testing** on a sample web application to identify and exploit common web vulnerabilities, including:

- 🔍 **SQL Injection**
- 💬 **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)**
- 🔐 **Authentication Flaws**

The goal was to simulate real-world attack scenarios using ethical hacking techniques and document the findings.

---

## 🛠️ Tools Utilized

- **OWASP ZAP** – Automated vulnerability scanner  
- **Burp Suite** – Intercepting proxy for manual testing  
- **SQLMap** – SQL injection and database takeover tool  

---

## 🧪 Vulnerabilities Identified

1. 🧨 **SQL Injection**
   - Found in the login form  
   - Exploited to bypass authentication and access the admin panel  

2. ⚠️ **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)**
   - Detected in the comment section  
   - Injected malicious JavaScript to steal session cookies  

3. 🚪 **Authentication Flaws**
   - No brute-force protection  
   - Login form accepted unlimited incorrect attempts

## 📁 Proof of Work

A screen recording demonstrating the complete testing process and tool usage is available:

📹 `proof_of_work/task01_demo.mp4`

This video walks through:
- Vulnerability scanning
- Manual exploitation using Burp Suite
- SQLMap injection automation
- Demonstration of XSS attack in action

## ✅ Outcome

This task helped enhance my practical understanding of:
- Vulnerability assessment
- Web attack vectors
- Ethical hacking methodologies

All findings were documented and will be used to recommend better security controls in future training modules.
